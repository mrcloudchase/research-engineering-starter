# Step 1: Curiosity & Problem Framing

## Overview

Research begins with curiosity. This step is about noticing a gap, mystery, or something unsolved and channeling that curiosity into a researchable problem.

## What You'll Do

Transform your curiosity into focused, researchable questions that can guide your investigation.

## Templates

- `curiosity-worksheet.md` - Template for exploring and framing your curiosity
- `perceptron-curiosity-example.md` - How Rosenblatt framed his curiosity in 1958

## Key Questions

- *Why do some machines fail at tasks humans find easy?*
- *Could a computer model how the brain learns?*
- *What makes certain approaches work where others fail?*

## Deliverable

A clear, focused research question that will guide your investigation.

## Exercise

Write down three curiosities you have in your area of interest. Then, try turning one into a focused question like:
- "How does ___ work?"
- "Why does ___ happen?"
- "Can we make ___ better?"
