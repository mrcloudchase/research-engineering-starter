# Perceptron Example: Step 1 - Curiosity & Problem Framing

## Rosenblatt's Original Curiosity (1958)

### The Historical Context
In 1958, Frank Rosenblatt was working at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, surrounded by early computers that could only follow pre-programmed instructions. He observed a fundamental limitation: machines could only do what they were explicitly told to do.

### His Curiosities

**Curiosity 1**: *Why can't machines learn like brains do?*
- **What puzzled him**: Biological brains could learn from experience, but machines couldn't
- **Why interesting**: This seemed like a fundamental limitation of computing
- **Focused question**: "Can we build a machine that learns like a brain?"

**Curiosity 2**: *How do biological neural networks actually learn?*
- **What puzzled him**: The mechanism behind neural learning and adaptation
- **Why interesting**: Understanding this could lead to artificial learning systems
- **Focused question**: "What is the mathematical basis of neural learning?"

**Curiosity 3**: *Could pattern recognition be automated?*
- **What puzzled him**: Manual pattern recognition was slow and error-prone
- **Why interesting**: Automation could solve many practical problems
- **Focused question**: "Can we create machines that recognize patterns automatically?"

### His Primary Research Question

**Chosen curiosity**: Building machines that learn like brains

**Research question**: "Can we build a machine that learns like a brain?"

**Why this question**: Combined his interests in psychology, mathematics, and practical computing applications

## Problem Framing (1958)

### Researchability Check

- ✅ **Specific enough**: Could define learning as improving performance on pattern recognition
- ✅ **Not too broad**: Focused on simple pattern learning, not general intelligence  
- ✅ **Existing work**: Could build on McCulloch-Pitts neurons and Hebb's learning rule
- ✅ **Testable**: Could measure performance on simple classification tasks
- ✅ **Personal investment**: Rosenblatt was passionate about bridging psychology and computing

### The Problem

**The problem**: Existing computing machines could only follow fixed instructions and couldn't improve their performance through experience.

**Why it mattered**: 
- Pattern recognition was critical for military applications (target identification)
- Manual programming for each new pattern was inefficient
- Biological systems demonstrated superior learning capabilities

**Who cared**: 
- Military researchers needing automated recognition systems
- Psychologists studying learning mechanisms
- Computer scientists seeking more flexible machines

**Success criteria**: 
- Create a machine that improves its pattern recognition accuracy through experience
- Demonstrate learning on simple classification tasks
- Provide mathematical foundation for the learning process

### Connection to Existing Knowledge

**What Rosenblatt knew**:
- McCulloch-Pitts (1943): Mathematical model of neurons as logic gates
- Hebb (1949): "Neurons that fire together, wire together" learning principle
- Basic computing: Early computers, programming, mathematical operations

**What he needed to learn**:
- How to make artificial neurons adaptive rather than fixed
- Mathematical formulation of learning rules
- Experimental validation methods for learning systems

**His starting point**: 
- McCulloch-Pitts neuron model as the foundation
- Hebb's learning principle as inspiration for weight modification
- Pattern recognition as the test domain

## The Research Question That Changed AI

Rosenblatt's curiosity led to the research question: **"Can we create a mathematical model that mimics the brain's ability to learn and recognize patterns automatically?"**

This question guided his literature review, led to the perceptron algorithm, and ultimately launched the field of neural networks.

## Key Insights for Modern Learners

1. **Start with genuine curiosity** - Rosenblatt was genuinely puzzled by the gap between biological and artificial learning
2. **Make it personal** - His interdisciplinary background (psychology + mathematics) shaped his unique perspective
3. **Focus on gaps** - He identified the specific limitation of existing systems (no learning capability)
4. **Think practically** - He connected theoretical questions to real-world applications

## Your Turn

Use this example as inspiration for framing your own curiosity:
- What genuinely puzzles you in your field?
- What gap between theory and practice do you notice?
- How can you turn that curiosity into a testable question?
