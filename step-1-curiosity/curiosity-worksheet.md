# Curiosity & Problem Framing Worksheet

## Your Research Area of Interest

**Field/Domain**: [e.g., Computer Science, Biology, Psychology, Economics]

**General Area**: [e.g., Machine Learning, Molecular Biology, Cognitive Science]

## Brainstorming Your Curiosities

### Curiosity 1
**What puzzles you?**: [Describe something that makes you curious]

**Why is this interesting?**: [What draws you to this question?]

**Focused question**: [Turn it into a specific "How/Why/Can" question]

### Curiosity 2
**What puzzles you?**: [Describe something that makes you curious]

**Why is this interesting?**: [What draws you to this question?]

**Focused question**: [Turn it into a specific "How/Why/Can" question]

### Curiosity 3
**What puzzles you?**: [Describe something that makes you curious]

**Why is this interesting?**: [What draws you to this question?]

**Focused question**: [Turn it into a specific "How/Why/Can" question]

## Selecting Your Primary Research Question

**Chosen curiosity**: [Which of the three interests you most?]

**Research question**: [Your focused, researchable question]

**Why this question?**: [What makes this the right starting point?]

## Researchability Check

For your chosen question, answer:

- [ ] **Is it specific enough?** (Can you define what success looks like?)
- [ ] **Is it too broad?** (Can you reasonably investigate it with available resources?)
- [ ] **Is there existing work?** (Are there papers to build on?)
- [ ] **Can you test it?** (Is there a way to gather evidence?)
- [ ] **Do you care?** (Will you stay motivated for 16 weeks?)

## Problem Framing

**The problem**: [What specific problem does your question address?]

**Why it matters**: [Why is solving this problem important?]

**Who cares**: [Who would benefit from an answer to this question?]

**Success criteria**: [How will you know if you've made progress?]

## Connection to Existing Knowledge

**What you already know**: [Any background knowledge you have]

**What you need to learn**: [Knowledge gaps you'll need to fill]

**Starting point**: [Where will you begin your literature review?]

## Next Steps

- [ ] Finalize your research question
- [ ] Document your problem framing
- [ ] Move to Step 2: Literature Review
- [ ] Use your research question to guide paper selection

**Remember**: Your curiosity is raw energy. The goal is to channel it into something researchable, not perfect it immediately.
