# Phase 4: Documentation

## üìù Week 13-14: Research Communication

This folder contains your research documentation and communication materials.

### Getting Started

Document your complete research journey for the community:

1. **Research Paper/Report**
2. **Tutorial Creation**
3. **Code Documentation**
4. **Reproducibility Guide**

### Tutorial Creation

Create a beginner-friendly tutorial showing others how to:

1. **Reproduce your work**
2. **Understand the key concepts**
3. **Apply the methodology to other problems**
4. **Avoid common pitfalls**

#### Tutorial Structure
- **Prerequisites**: What readers need to know
- **Setup**: Environment and tool installation
- **Step-by-step implementation**: Detailed walkthrough
- **Explanation**: Why each step matters
- **Extensions**: How to adapt for other uses
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions

### Documentation Best Practices

#### Clarity
- Use clear, simple language
- Define technical terms
- Provide context and motivation
- Include visual aids and examples

#### Completeness
- Document all steps and decisions
- Include negative results and failures
- Provide complete code and data
- List all dependencies and requirements

#### Reproducibility
- Exact environment specifications
- Complete parameter settings
- Random seed documentation
- Data preprocessing steps

### Example: Perceptron Journey Documentation

If following the Perceptron example:

#### Research Report
- "From Perceptron to Multi-Layer Networks: Discovering the XOR Problem and Training Solutions"
- Document the complete journey from literature review to MLP implementation
- Include historical context about the 25-year training bottleneck

#### Tutorial
- "Building Neural Networks from Scratch: A Beginner's Guide to the Perceptron Problem"
- Step-by-step implementation guide
- Explanation of why XOR is challenging
- Introduction to multi-layer solutions
