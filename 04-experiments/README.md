# Step 5: Systematic Experimentation

**Research Step**: Experimentation

## Overview

Use your implementation to systematically test your hypotheses. This is where you generate the data that will answer your research questions.

## Your Task

Design and execute rigorous experiments that test each of your hypotheses with proper controls and statistical methodology.

## Experimental Methodology

### Research Engineering Principles
1. **Systematic approach**: Test one variable at a time
2. **Proper controls**: Include baselines and comparisons
3. **Statistical rigor**: Multiple runs, significance testing
4. **Documentation**: Record everything for reproducibility
5. **Honest reporting**: Document failures as well as successes

### Experimental Design Framework
- **Independent variables**: What you're manipulating
- **Dependent variables**: What you're measuring
- **Control variables**: What you're keeping constant
- **Confounding variables**: What might interfere

## Types of Experiments

### Hypothesis Testing Experiments
**Purpose**: Test your specific predictions
**Design**: Direct comparison between conditions
**Analysis**: Statistical tests for significance

### Ablation Studies
**Purpose**: Understand which components matter
**Design**: Systematically remove/modify components
**Analysis**: Component importance ranking

### Parameter Sweeps
**Purpose**: Find optimal configurations
**Design**: Systematic variation of parameters
**Analysis**: Performance landscapes and sensitivity

### Failure Mode Analysis
**Purpose**: Understand limitations and boundaries
**Design**: Test edge cases and challenging scenarios
**Analysis**: Characterize when/why methods fail

## Experiment Documentation

### Experiment Log Template
For each experiment, document:

```markdown
# Experiment: [Name]
**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Objective**: [What are you testing?]

## Hypothesis
[Which hypothesis this tests and specific prediction]

## Configuration
- **Parameters**: [All settings and values]
- **Data**: [Dataset, size, preprocessing]
- **Environment**: [Software versions, hardware]
- **Random seeds**: [For reproducibility]

## Results
- **Primary metrics**: [Main measurements]
- **Statistical analysis**: [p-values, effect sizes, confidence intervals]
- **Visualizations**: [Plots and charts]

## Observations
- **Expected results**: [What matched predictions]
- **Surprises**: [Unexpected findings]
- **Failures**: [What didn't work and why]

## Conclusions
- **Hypothesis support**: [Supported/refuted/partially supported]
- **Key insights**: [What you learned]
- **Next experiments**: [What to test next]
```

## Success Criteria

By completing this step, you should have:
- [ ] **Systematic test results** for all hypotheses
- [ ] **Statistical analysis** with proper significance testing
- [ ] **Comprehensive documentation** of all experiments
- [ ] **Clear findings** about what works and what doesn't
- [ ] **Identified limitations** for future research

## Common Experimental Challenges

### Challenge: Results Don't Support Hypotheses
**Solution**: This is valuable! Negative results teach us about limitations

### Challenge: Experiments Take Too Long
**Solution**: Start with pilot studies, scale up after validating approach

### Challenge: Too Many Variables
**Solution**: Test one factor at a time, use systematic ablation

### Challenge: Inconsistent Results
**Solution**: Check for random seed issues, increase sample size

## Experimental Strategy

### Week 1: Core Hypothesis Testing
- [ ] Test primary hypothesis with direct comparison
- [ ] Run multiple trials for statistical validity
- [ ] Document baseline performance
- [ ] Analyze initial results

### Week 2: Systematic Investigation
- [ ] Conduct ablation studies
- [ ] Test parameter sensitivity
- [ ] Explore failure modes
- [ ] Compile comprehensive results

## Next Steps

Once your experiments are complete:
1. **Move to Step 6-7**: [Analysis & Iteration](../05-analysis/)
2. **Interpret your findings**: What do the results mean?
3. **Plan iterations**: How will you refine your approach?

**Remember**: Experiments are conversations with reality. Listen carefully to what your results are telling you, even if it's not what you expected to hear.
