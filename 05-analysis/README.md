# Step 6-7: Analysis & Iteration

**Research Steps**: Analysis & Interpretation + Iteration

## Overview

Make sense of your experimental results and refine your approach based on what you've learned. This is where data becomes knowledge.

## Your Task

Analyze your experimental results, interpret their meaning, and plan iterations based on your findings.

## Analysis Framework

### Statistical Analysis Steps
1. **Descriptive statistics**: Summarize your data
2. **Hypothesis testing**: Test for statistical significance
3. **Effect size calculation**: Determine practical significance
4. **Confidence intervals**: Quantify uncertainty
5. **Multiple comparisons**: Correct for family-wise error

### Interpretation Guidelines
- **Be conservative**: Don't overstate findings
- **Consider alternatives**: What other explanations exist?
- **Acknowledge limitations**: What are the weaknesses?
- **Think about generalizability**: Do findings apply beyond your study?

## Analysis Components

### Results Summary
**What happened**: Objective description of findings
**Statistical significance**: p-values and confidence intervals
**Effect sizes**: Practical magnitude of differences
**Patterns observed**: Trends and relationships in data

### Interpretation
**What it means**: Your explanation of the results
**Mechanism**: Why you think these results occurred
**Implications**: What this suggests about your hypotheses
**Limitations**: What the results don't tell you

### Iteration Planning
**What worked**: Successful aspects to build on
**What didn't work**: Problems to address
**Refinements needed**: Improvements for next iteration
**New questions**: What your results suggest investigating next

## Analysis Template

### Results Analysis Structure
1. **Hypothesis Testing Results**
   - Which hypotheses were supported?
   - Statistical evidence for each finding
   - Effect sizes and practical significance

2. **Unexpected Findings**
   - Results that surprised you
   - Patterns you didn't predict
   - Failures that taught you something

3. **Limitation Discovery**
   - Boundaries of your approach
   - Cases where methods failed
   - Systematic characterization of limitations

4. **Iteration Planning**
   - Refinements needed
   - New experiments to run
   - Different approaches to try

## Success Criteria

By completing this step, you should have:
- [ ] **Statistical analysis** of all experimental results
- [ ] **Clear interpretation** of what findings mean
- [ ] **Honest assessment** of limitations discovered
- [ ] **Iteration plan** for improving your approach
- [ ] **New research questions** emerging from your work

## Common Analysis Challenges

### Challenge: Results Don't Support Hypotheses
**Solution**: Negative results are valuable data! Analyze why hypotheses were wrong

### Challenge: Results Are Ambiguous
**Solution**: Consider alternative interpretations, plan additional experiments

### Challenge: Statistical Significance Without Practical Meaning
**Solution**: Focus on effect sizes, not just p-values

### Challenge: Too Much Data to Interpret
**Solution**: Start with primary hypotheses, then explore secondary findings

## The Iteration Mindset

### Embrace "Failure"
- **Failed hypotheses**: Teach you about boundaries and limitations
- **Unexpected results**: Often lead to the most important discoveries
- **Implementation problems**: Reveal practical challenges worth investigating

### Research Engineering Approach
- **Systematic investigation**: Follow the data where it leads
- **Honest documentation**: Record both successes and failures
- **Methodical iteration**: Make one change at a time
- **Community sharing**: Discuss findings with others for perspective

## Next Steps

Once your analysis is complete:
1. **Move to Step 8-10**: [Documentation & Communication](../06-documentation/)
2. **Prepare to share**: Transform findings into communicable knowledge
3. **Plan next cycle**: Use limitations to guide future research

**Remember**: Analysis is where you transform data into knowledge. Be thorough, honest, and open to unexpected insights.
