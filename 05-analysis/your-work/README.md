# Your Analysis & Iteration

This is your workspace for Steps 6-7: Analysis & Iteration.

## Getting Started

1. Review the analysis example in `../perceptron-example/results-analysis.md`
2. Analyze your experimental results systematically
3. Interpret what your findings mean
4. Plan iterations based on discoveries

## Analysis Components

### 1. Results Summary
- **Hypothesis outcomes**: Which were supported/refuted?
- **Statistical evidence**: Significance tests and effect sizes
- **Key metrics**: Performance measures across experiments
- **Unexpected findings**: Surprises and anomalies

### 2. Interpretation
- **What it means**: Explain your results
- **Why it happened**: Mechanistic understanding
- **Implications**: What this tells us about the problem
- **Limitations**: What results don't tell us

### 3. Visualization
- **Learning curves**: Training progress over time
- **Comparison plots**: Different methods/configurations
- **Statistical plots**: Distributions, confidence intervals
- **Conceptual diagrams**: Illustrate key insights

### 4. Iteration Planning
- **What worked**: Build on successes
- **What didn't**: Address failures
- **New questions**: What results suggest exploring
- **Refinements**: Improvements for next cycle

## Statistical Analysis Checklist

- [ ] Descriptive statistics (means, stdev, ranges)
- [ ] Hypothesis tests (t-tests, ANOVA, etc.)
- [ ] Effect sizes (Cohen's d, η², etc.)
- [ ] Confidence intervals
- [ ] Multiple comparisons correction
- [ ] Assumption checking (normality, etc.)

## Interpretation Guidelines

### Be Conservative
- Don't overstate findings
- Acknowledge uncertainty
- Consider alternative explanations
- Discuss limitations honestly

### Think Deeply
- **Mechanism**: Why did this happen?
- **Generalization**: Do findings apply broadly?
- **Practical significance**: Beyond statistical significance
- **Theoretical implications**: What this means for the field

## Common Analysis Patterns

### When Hypotheses Are Supported
1. Quantify the strength of support
2. Explore boundary conditions
3. Look for unexpected nuances
4. Plan extensions and applications

### When Hypotheses Are Refuted
1. Understand why predictions were wrong
2. Identify what actually happened
3. Revise theoretical understanding
4. Design new experiments

### When Results Are Mixed
1. Identify conditions for success/failure
2. Look for hidden variables
3. Refine hypotheses
4. Plan targeted follow-ups

## Visualization Best Practices

- **Clear labels**: Axes, legends, titles
- **Appropriate plot types**: Match visualization to data
- **Statistical indicators**: Error bars, confidence bands
- **Colorblind friendly**: Accessible palettes
- **High quality**: Publication-ready figures

## Iteration Mindset

### Research is Cyclic
- Each iteration builds on the last
- Failures teach as much as successes
- Refinement leads to insight
- Knowledge accumulates gradually

### Planning Next Steps
1. **Address weaknesses**: Fix problems identified
2. **Explore surprises**: Investigate unexpected findings
3. **Extend successes**: Build on what worked
4. **Test boundaries**: Find limits of your approach

## Tips

- **Be honest**: Report what actually happened
- **Show your work**: Include calculations and code
- **Tell a story**: Connect findings into narrative
- **Think critically**: Question your own results
- **Stay curious**: Let findings guide new questions
