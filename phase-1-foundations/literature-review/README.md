# Phase 1: Literature Review

## ðŸ“š Week 1-2: Research Fundamentals

This folder contains your literature review work for your chosen research paper.

### Getting Started

1. **Choose your foundational paper** using the [selection criteria](https://averagejoeslab.com/docs/intro#how-to-choose-your-starting-paper)
2. **Use the comprehensive template** in `literature-review-template.md`
3. **Create your literature review** as `[paper-name]-literature-review.md`
4. **Follow the example** in `perceptron-literature-review.md` for guidance

### File Structure

**Template and Example Files:**
- `literature-review-template.md` - Comprehensive template for any research field
- `perceptron-literature-review.md` - Complete example using the Perceptron paper
- `README.md` - This guide

**Your Work:**
- `[your-paper-name]-literature-review.md` - Your completed literature review

### Using the Literature Review Template

The `literature-review-template.md` provides a comprehensive 10-section structure:

1. **Paper Selection** - Document your choice and rationale
2. **Paper Overview** - Basic information and key contributions
3. **Historical Context** - Timeline, prior work, and contemporary landscape
4. **Key Concepts** - Core theoretical concepts and methodological innovations
5. **Technical Analysis** - Detailed breakdown of methods and algorithms
6. **Significance and Impact** - Reception, influence, and field transformation
7. **Limitations and Critique** - Known problems and subsequent critiques
8. **Modern Connections** - Evolution of ideas and current applications
9. **Research Questions for Phase 3** - Your experimental design preview
10. **References and Sources** - Comprehensive annotated bibliography

**Template Features:**
- Field-agnostic design (works for any research domain)
- Detailed guidance and prompts for each section
- Built-in progress tracking with checkboxes
- Research methodology tips and quality checklist
- Works for both historical and recent papers

### Example: Perceptron Literature Review

The `perceptron-literature-review.md` file provides a complete example of the template in action:

**What it demonstrates:**
- How to conduct systematic literature review using the template
- Comprehensive analysis from paper selection through research questions
- Integration of historical context, technical analysis, and modern connections
- Proper citation and bibliography formatting
- Research question formulation for Phase 3 experimentation

**Key insights from the example:**
- Shows the perceptron's role in AI history (breakthrough â†’ critique â†’ renaissance)
- Demonstrates how to analyze both capabilities and limitations
- Connects historical work to modern deep learning
- Illustrates systematic experimental design planning

**Use it as a guide for:**
- Understanding the depth of analysis expected
- Seeing how different sections connect and build on each other
- Learning proper academic research methodology
- Preparing for implementation and experimentation phases
