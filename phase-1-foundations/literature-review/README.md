# Phase 1: Literature Review

## ðŸ“š Week 1-2: Research Fundamentals

This folder contains your literature review work for your chosen research paper.

### Getting Started

1. **Choose your foundational paper** using the [selection criteria](https://averagejoeslab.com/docs/intro#how-to-choose-your-starting-paper)
2. **Document your paper choice** in `paper-selection.md`
3. **Conduct your literature review** following the structure below

### Recommended Structure

Create the following files in this directory:

- `paper-selection.md` - Document why you chose your paper
- `literature-review.md` - Your comprehensive literature review
- `historical-context.md` - Historical background and significance
- `key-concepts.md` - Important concepts and terminology
- `references.md` - All sources and citations

### Literature Review Template

Your literature review should address:

1. **Paper Overview**
   - Title, authors, publication year
   - Main research question or problem
   - Key contributions and findings

2. **Historical Context**
   - What problem was the research trying to solve?
   - What was the state of the field before this work?
   - Why was this research important at the time?

3. **Theoretical Foundation**
   - What theories or principles does the work build on?
   - How does the methodology work?
   - What assumptions are made?

4. **Significance and Impact**
   - Why was this breakthrough important?
   - How did it influence later research?
   - What limitations or problems did it reveal?

5. **Related Work**
   - What other papers build on this work?
   - What alternative approaches exist?
   - How does this fit into the broader field?
