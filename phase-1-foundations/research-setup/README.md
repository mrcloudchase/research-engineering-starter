# Phase 1: Research Setup

## üõ†Ô∏è Week 3-4: Data and Analysis Setup

This folder contains your initial research environment and tool setup.

### Getting Started

Set up your research environment following research engineering best practices:

1. **Development Environment**
2. **Version Control**
3. **Documentation System**
4. **Reference Management**

### Recommended Files

Create the following files in this directory:

- `environment-setup.md` - Document your development environment
- `tools-list.md` - List of tools and software you're using
- `data-sources.md` - Document your data sources and datasets
- `methodology-notes.md` - Notes on your research methodology

### Environment Setup Checklist

#### Programming Environment
