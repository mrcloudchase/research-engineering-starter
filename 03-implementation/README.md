# Step 4: Implementation & Methodology

**Research Step**: Methodology Design

## Overview

Transform your hypotheses into working code and experimental methodology. This is where theoretical ideas become testable reality.

## Your Task

Implement your research concepts from scratch, creating the tools needed to test your hypotheses systematically.

## Implementation Philosophy

### Start Simple, Build Systematically
1. **Core algorithm first** - Implement the basic concept
2. **Add testing** - Verify each component works
3. **Build incrementally** - Add complexity gradually
4. **Document everything** - Code should be self-explanatory

### Research Engineering Principles
- **Reproducibility**: Others should be able to run your code
- **Modularity**: Separate components for easy testing
- **Clarity**: Code should be readable and well-documented
- **Testability**: Every function should be testable

## Templates and Structure

### Recommended Code Organization
```

├── src/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── model.py              # Main algorithm
│   ├── data_utils.py         # Data handling
│   ├── evaluation.py         # Metrics and testing
│   └── visualization.py      # Plotting and analysis
├── tests/
│   ├── test_model.py
│   ├── test_data_utils.py
│   └── test_evaluation.py
├── notebooks/
│   ├── exploration.ipynb     # Initial experiments
│   └── validation.ipynb      # Systematic testing
├── requirements.txt          # Dependencies
└── README.md                 # Implementation documentation
```

### Implementation Best Practices
- **Clean code**: Clear variable names, consistent style
- **Comprehensive comments**: Explain the algorithm, not just the code
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of edge cases
- **Type hints**: Clear function signatures
- **Docstrings**: Document all functions and classes

## Success Criteria

By completing this step, you should have:
- [ ] **Working implementation** of your research concept
- [ ] **Comprehensive tests** verifying correctness
- [ ] **Clean, documented code** that others can understand
- [ ] **Experimental framework** ready for systematic testing
- [ ] **Baseline comparisons** implemented

## Common Implementation Challenges

### Challenge: Algorithm Doesn't Work as Expected
**Solution**: Start with the simplest possible version, verify each component separately

### Challenge: Code Becomes Complex and Messy
**Solution**: Refactor regularly, write tests first, use version control

### Challenge: Can't Reproduce Paper's Results
**Solution**: This is common and valuable! Document the differences - understanding why results differ is research

### Challenge: Implementation Takes Too Long
**Solution**: Focus on core algorithm first, add bells and whistles later

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Algorithm (Days 1-3)
- [ ] Implement basic algorithm from your paper
- [ ] Create simple test cases
- [ ] Verify it runs without errors
- [ ] Document basic usage

### Phase 2: Systematic Testing (Days 4-5)
- [ ] Implement comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Add evaluation metrics
- [ ] Create baseline comparisons
- [ ] Test on multiple scenarios

### Phase 3: Research Framework (Days 6-7)
- [ ] Build experimental framework
- [ ] Add data visualization
- [ ] Create reproducible workflows
- [ ] Prepare for systematic experimentation

## Next Steps

Once your implementation is complete:
1. **Move to Step 5**: [Experiments](../04-experiments/)
2. **Test your hypotheses**: Use your implementation for systematic testing
3. **Document discoveries**: Record what works and what doesn't

**Remember**: Implementation is where you discover what really works. Expect surprises - they're often the most valuable findings!
