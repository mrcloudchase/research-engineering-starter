# Your Implementation

This is your workspace for Step 4: Implementation & Methodology.

## Getting Started

1. Review the perceptron example in `../perceptron-example/`
2. Create your implementation structure based on your hypotheses
3. Build incrementally - start simple, add complexity
4. Test everything as you build

## Suggested Structure

```

│   ├── data_utils.py        # Data handling utilities
│   └── visualization.py     # Plotting and analysis
├── tests/                    # Unit tests

```

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Core algorithm from your paper
- [ ] Data generation/loading utilities
- [ ] Evaluation metrics
- [ ] Visualization functions
- [ ] Unit tests for validation
- [ ] Documentation and comments
- [ ] Reproducible setup (requirements.txt)

## Tips

- **Start simple**: Get a basic version working first
- **Test early**: Write tests as you code
- **Document**: Your future self will thank you
- **Version control**: Commit working versions frequently
- **Ask for help**: Use the Discord community when stuck

When complete, move to [Step 5: Experiments](../../04-experiments/)
