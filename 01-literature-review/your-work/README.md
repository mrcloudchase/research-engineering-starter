# Your Literature Review

This is your workspace for Step 1-2: Literature Review & Problem Framing.

## Getting Started

1. Copy `../literature-review-template.md` to this directory
2. Rename it to `[your-paper-name]-literature-review.md`
3. Fill out each section systematically
4. Reference `../perceptron-example/` for guidance on depth and style

## What Goes Here

- Your completed literature review
- Additional research notes
- Bibliography and references
- Any supporting documents

## Tips

- Take your time with this foundational step
- Use the perceptron example as a reference for quality
- Document everything - even things that seem obvious now
- Focus on understanding deeply before moving to hypotheses

When complete, move to [Step 3: Hypothesis Design](../../02-hypothesis-design/)
