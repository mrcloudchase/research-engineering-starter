# Step 1-2: Literature Review & Problem Framing

**Research Steps**: Curiosity & Problem Framing + Literature Review

## Overview

This folder supports the first two steps of the research process:
1. **Curiosity & Problem Framing** - Identify and refine your research question
2. **Literature Review** - Map existing knowledge and find gaps

## Getting Started

### Choose Your Path
- **Path A**: Follow our perceptron example with provided templates
- **Path B**: Apply the methodology to your own chosen paper

### Your Tasks
1. **Select your research paper** (use `../paper-recommendations.md` for ideas)
2. **Complete the literature review** using the provided template
3. **Identify research gaps** that will guide your later work

```

## Templates and Examples

### Literature Review Template
Use `literature-review-template.md` - a comprehensive 10-section template that works for any research field:

1. **Paper Selection** - Document your choice and rationale
2. **Paper Overview** - Basic information and key contributions
3. **Historical Context** - Timeline and contemporary landscape
4. **Key Concepts** - Core theoretical and methodological concepts
5. **Technical Analysis** - Detailed breakdown of methods
6. **Significance and Impact** - Reception and influence
7. **Limitations and Critique** - Problems and subsequent critiques
8. **Modern Connections** - Evolution and current applications
9. **Research Questions** - What you'll investigate next
10. **References** - Comprehensive bibliography

### Perceptron Example
Study `perceptron-example/perceptron-literature-review.md` to see:
- How to apply the template systematically
- Depth of analysis expected
- How to identify research opportunities
- Connection between literature review and future research

## Learning Resources

## Success Criteria

By completing this step, you should have:
- [ ] **Clear research question** that is specific and testable
- [ ] **Comprehensive literature review** showing deep understanding
- [ ] **Identified gaps** in existing knowledge
- [ ] **Research opportunities** for your next steps
- [ ] **Strong foundation** for hypothesis formation

## Common Challenges

### Challenge: Information Overload
**Solution**: Use the layered reading strategy from the learning path. Start with abstracts and conclusions.

### Challenge: Understanding Complex Concepts
**Solution**: Focus on intuition first, mathematical rigor second. Use visual resources.

### Challenge: Finding the Right Scope
**Solution**: Start broad, then narrow down. Use the template to guide your focus.

## Next Steps

Once your literature review is complete:
1. **Move to Step 3**: [Hypothesis Design](../02-hypothesis-design/)
2. **Use your findings**: Let the gaps you identified guide your hypotheses
3. **Stay connected**: Share progress in the [Discord community](https://discord.gg/7gzZMAPuGr)

**Remember**: A thorough literature review is the foundation of all good research. Take time to understand the landscape before moving forward.
