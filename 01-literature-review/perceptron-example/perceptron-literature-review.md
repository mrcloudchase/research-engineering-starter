## 5. Technical Analysis

### Algorithm Details
```
Initialize: w = small_random_values, b = 0
For each training example (x, y):
    prediction = step_function(w·x + b)
    error = y - prediction
    if error ≠ 0:
        w = w + learning_rate × error × x
        b = b + learning_rate × error
```

### Mathematical Foundation
- **Decision boundary**: Hyperplane dividing input space
- **Weight vector**: Normal to decision boundary
- **Learning rule**: Gradient-free error correction
- **Convergence**: Guaranteed for linearly separable data

### Implementation Requirements
- **1950s constraints**: Limited memory, slow processing, batch operation
- **Algorithm efficiency**: O(n) per update, linear scaling
- **Storage needs**: Only weights and current example

### Experimental Validation
- **Logic gates**: AND, OR (successful), XOR (failed)
