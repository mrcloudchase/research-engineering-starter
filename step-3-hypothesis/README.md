# Step 3: Hypothesis & Goal Setting

## Overview

A **hypothesis** is a guess you can test. It connects your curiosity to a concrete direction and provides a framework for your research.

## What You'll Do

Transform your research question from Step 1 into testable hypotheses with clear predictions.

## Templates

- `hypothesis-worksheet.md` - Template for formulating testable hypotheses
- `perceptron-hypothesis-example.md` - How Rosenblatt formed his hypothesis

## Key Format

Write hypotheses in the form:
- "If ___, then ___, because ___."

## Examples

- *"If we design a simple computational unit that mimics a neuron, then we can train it to recognize simple patterns."*
- *"If we add nonlinear functions to a model, then it can solve problems the linear model cannot."*

## Deliverable

Clear, testable hypotheses that will guide your methodology design.

## Exercise

Write a hypothesis for your research question using the "If-then-because" format.

## Next Step

Once you have your hypothesis, move to **[Step 4: Methodology Design](../step-4-methodology/README.md)**
