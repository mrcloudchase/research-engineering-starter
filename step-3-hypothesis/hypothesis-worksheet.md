# Hypothesis & Goal Setting Worksheet

## From Question to Hypothesis

**Your research question** (from Step 1): [Copy your focused research question]

**Background understanding** (from Step 2): [Key insights from your literature review]

## Hypothesis Formation

### Primary Hypothesis

**If-then-because statement**:
If [what you will do/change], then [what you expect to happen], because [your reasoning based on literature review].

**Example**: If we implement a perceptron learning algorithm, then it can learn to classify linearly separable patterns, because the literature shows that adaptive weight adjustment can approximate decision boundaries.

### Alternative Hypotheses

**Hypothesis 2**:
If [alternative approach], then [expected outcome], because [reasoning].

**Hypothesis 3** (if applicable):
If [another approach], then [expected outcome], because [reasoning].

## Predictions

### What Will Happen If You're Right?

**Observable outcomes**:
- [Specific result 1 you expect to see]
- [Specific result 2 you expect to see]
- [Specific result 3 you expect to see]

**Measurable criteria**:
- [How you'll measure success - e.g., accuracy > 90%]
- [Timeline for results - e.g., convergence within 100 iterations]
- [Comparison baseline - e.g., better than random classifier]

### What Will Happen If You're Wrong?

**Possible failure modes**:
- [What might go wrong - e.g., algorithm doesn't converge]
- [Why it might fail - e.g., problem isn't linearly separable]
- [How you'll recognize failure - e.g., accuracy stays at chance level]

**Learning value of failure**:
- [What you'd learn if the hypothesis is wrong]
- [How failure would guide next steps]

## Scope and Limitations

### What Your Hypothesis Covers

**Scope**: [What specific cases/conditions your hypothesis applies to]

**Assumptions**: [What you're assuming to be true]

**Constraints**: [Limitations of your approach]

### What Your Hypothesis Doesn't Cover

**Out of scope**: [What you're not trying to address]

**Future work**: [What could be explored later]

**Known limitations**: [What you expect might not work]

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics

**Quantitative measures**:
- [Numerical criteria for success - e.g., accuracy, speed, efficiency]
- [Statistical significance requirements]
- [Performance benchmarks]

**Qualitative measures**:
- [Conceptual understanding gained]
- [Insights about the problem domain]
- [Clarity of implementation]

### Minimum Viable Success

**What's the smallest success** that would validate your hypothesis?
[Define the minimum result that would be meaningful]

**Partial validation**: 
[What would constitute partial support for your hypothesis?]

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Assumptions

**Assumption 1**: [Something you're assuming that might not be true]
- **Risk level**: [High/Medium/Low]
- **Mitigation**: [How you'll address this if it's wrong]

**Assumption 2**: [Another assumption]
- **Risk level**: [High/Medium/Low]
- **Mitigation**: [How you'll address this if it's wrong]

### Backup Plans

**If primary hypothesis fails**:
- [Alternative approach 1]
- [Alternative approach 2]
- [How you'll pivot]

## Timeline and Resources

### Time Estimation

**Literature review**: [Hours/weeks needed]
**Implementation**: [Hours/weeks needed]
**Experimentation**: [Hours/weeks needed]
**Analysis**: [Hours/weeks needed]

### Resource Requirements

**Computational**: [What computing resources you'll need]
**Data**: [What data you'll need to collect or find]
**Tools**: [Software, libraries, or equipment needed]
**Knowledge**: [Skills you'll need to develop]

## Connection to Methodology

**How will you test this hypothesis?** [Brief preview of your experimental approach]

**What evidence will support/refute it?** [What you'll look for in results]

**How will you measure it?** [Specific metrics and evaluation methods]

**Completed**: [Date]
**Next Step**: Move to Step 4: Methodology Design to plan how you'll test your hypothesis.

**Key Insight**: A good hypothesis is specific enough to be wrong. If you can't imagine what would disprove it, make it more specific.
