# Your Hypothesis Design

This is your workspace for Step 3: Hypothesis Formation.

## Getting Started

1. Copy `../hypothesis-template.md` to this directory
2. Rename it to `[your-paper-name]-hypotheses.md`
3. Transform your literature review findings into testable predictions
4. Reference `../perceptron-example/` for hypothesis formulation examples

## What Goes Here

- Your hypothesis design document
- Alternative hypotheses you considered
- Experimental design notes
- Success criteria definitions

## Tips

- Make hypotheses specific and testable
- Include both null and alternative hypotheses
- Think about how you'll measure success
- Consider what negative results would teach you

When complete, move to [Step 4: Implementation](../../03-implementation/)
