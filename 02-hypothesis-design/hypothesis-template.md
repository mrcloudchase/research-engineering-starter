# Hypothesis Design Template

*Transform your literature review findings into testable predictions*

## Instructions

1. **Review your literature review** - What gaps or limitations did you identify?
2. **Formulate hypotheses** that address these gaps
3. **Make predictions specific** and testable
4. **Plan how to test** each hypothesis

## Research Foundation

### From Literature Review
**Paper studied**: [Your chosen paper]
**Key limitation identified**: [Main limitation you want to address]
**Research opportunity**: [Why this limitation matters]

### Research Question
**Primary question**: [From your literature review]
**Why this matters**: [Significance of answering this question]

## Hypothesis Formulation

### Primary Hypothesis

#### Hypothesis Statement
**H₁**: [Your main prediction in if-then-because format]

**Example format**: "If [condition], then [specific prediction], because [mechanism]"

#### Null Hypothesis
**H₀**: [The "no effect" alternative]

#### Specific Predictions
- **Quantitative prediction**: [Specific numbers or ranges]
- **Qualitative prediction**: [What patterns you expect]
- **Comparison prediction**: [How it compares to baseline]

#### Justification
**Why you think this is true**:
1. [Reason 1 from literature]
2. [Reason 2 from theory]
3. [Reason 3 from analogies]

### Secondary Hypotheses

#### Hypothesis 2
**H₁**: [Second testable prediction]
**H₀**: [Corresponding null hypothesis]
**Rationale**: [Why you think this might be true]

#### Hypothesis 3
**H₁**: [Third testable prediction]
**H₀**: [Corresponding null hypothesis]
**Rationale**: [Why you think this might be true]

**Experimental approach**: [Type of experiment/study]
**What you'll measure**: [Dependent variables]
**What you'll manipulate**: [Independent variables]
**Success criteria**: [What results would support hypothesis]
**Failure criteria**: [What results would refute hypothesis]

#### Secondary Tests
**Hypothesis 2 test**: [Brief description]
**Hypothesis 3 test**: [Brief description]

### Controls and Comparisons

## Predictions and Success Criteria

### Quantitative Predictions
- **Primary metric**: [Main measurement] should be [specific value/range]
- **Secondary metrics**: [Additional measurements] should show [predicted patterns]
- **Statistical significance**: Expecting p < 0.05 with effect size d > [value]

### Qualitative Predictions
- **Behavioral patterns**: [What patterns you expect to see]
- **Failure modes**: [How/when you expect failures]
- **Learning curves**: [Expected progression over time]

### Alternative Outcomes
**If hypothesis is wrong**: [What you'd learn from negative results]
**Unexpected results**: [How you'd handle surprising findings]
**Partial support**: [What partial confirmation would mean]

## Risk Assessment

### Potential Problems
- **Technical challenges**: [Implementation difficulties you anticipate]
- **Resource limitations**: [Constraints that might affect results]
- **Methodological issues**: [Potential confounds or biases]

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Problem 1 solution**: [How you'll address it]
- **Problem 2 solution**: [How you'll address it]
- **Backup plans**: [Alternative approaches if main plan fails]
