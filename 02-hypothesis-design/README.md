# Step 3: Hypothesis Design

**Research Step**: Hypothesis & Goal Setting

## Overview

Transform the gaps identified in your literature review into testable predictions. This step bridges the gap between understanding existing knowledge and designing experiments to generate new knowledge.

## Your Task

Create clear, testable hypotheses based on the limitations or questions you identified in your literature review.

## What Makes a Strong Hypothesis

### Essential Characteristics
- **Testable**: You can design an experiment to test it
- **Specific**: Clear predictions about what will happen
- **Falsifiable**: You can imagine results that would prove it wrong
- **Based on reasoning**: Flows logically from your literature review

### Hypothesis Structure
**If [condition/intervention]**, then **[specific prediction]**, because **[underlying mechanism]**.

### Types of Hypotheses
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: "No effect" or "no difference"
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: Your actual prediction
- **Directional**: Predicts direction of effect (better/worse)
- **Non-directional**: Predicts difference without specifying direction

## Templates and Examples

### Hypothesis Template
Use `hypothesis-template.md` to systematically develop your predictions.

### Perceptron Example
Study `perceptron-example/perceptron-hypotheses.md` to see:
- How to convert literature review findings into testable hypotheses
- Multiple hypothesis formulation for the same research question
- Connection between biological inspiration and mathematical predictions

- **[Scientific Method](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/intro-to-biology/science-of-biology/a/the-science-of-biology)** - Hypothesis in scientific context

### Experimental Design Foundations

- **[PICO Framework](https://guides.library.oregonstate.edu/c.php?g=286121&p=1906399)** - Structured hypothesis formation

## Success Criteria

By completing this step, you should have:
- [ ] **Primary hypothesis** clearly stated and justified
- [ ] **Alternative hypotheses** for different aspects of your research
- [ ] **Null hypotheses** properly formulated
- [ ] **Testable predictions** with specific success criteria
- [ ] **Experimental preview** of how you'll test your hypotheses

## Common Challenges

### Challenge: Hypothesis Too Broad
**Solution**: Break down into specific, measurable components

### Challenge: Not Testable
**Solution**: Ensure you can design a concrete experiment

### Challenge: No Clear Mechanism
**Solution**: Explain WHY you think your prediction will be true

## Next Steps

Once your hypotheses are formulated:
1. **Move to Step 4**: [Implementation](../03-implementation/)
2. **Design your methodology**: Plan how to test your hypotheses
3. **Stay systematic**: Let your hypotheses guide your experimental design

**Remember**: Good hypotheses make the rest of your research straightforward. Take time to get them right.
