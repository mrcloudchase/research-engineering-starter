## 🎯 How to Use This Template

### Phase 1: Research Foundations (Weeks 1-4)
- Use `phase-1-foundations/literature-review/` for your literature review work
- Document your research setup in `phase-1-foundations/research-setup/`

### Phase 2: Technical Skills (Weeks 5-8)
- Implement your chosen paper in `phase-2-technical-skills/implementation/`
- Track experiments in `phase-2-technical-skills/experiments/`
- Document tool setup in `phase-2-technical-skills/tools-setup/`

### Phase 3: Research Practice (Weeks 9-12)
- Design your research project in `phase-3-research-practice/hypothesis-design/`
- Conduct experiments in `phase-3-research-practice/experiments/`
- Analyze results in `phase-3-research-practice/analysis/`

### Phase 4: Community Contribution (Weeks 13-16)
- Create documentation in `phase-4-community-contribution/documentation/`
- Prepare presentations in `phase-4-community-contribution/presentations/`
- Share community contributions in `phase-4-community-contribution/community/`

## 🔬 Research Engineering Best Practices

This template follows research engineering best practices:

- **Version Control**: All work is tracked in Git
- **Reproducibility**: Clear documentation and environment setup
- **Experiment Tracking**: Systematic logging of experiments and results
- **Open Science**: Transparent sharing of methods and findings

## 🤝 Community

- **Join the [Average Joes Lab Discord](https://discord.gg/averagejoeslab)** for support and collaboration
- **Share your progress** using the `#research-engineering-path` channel
- **Find mentors** and collaborate with fellow researchers
- **Contribute back** by helping newcomers on their journey

## 📚 Learning Resources

All the resources you need are linked in the [Research Engineering Learning Path](https://averagejoeslab.com/docs/intro), including:

- Free tutorials for every tool and concept
- Step-by-step guides for each phase
- Examples across different research fields
- Community support and mentorship

## 🌟 Getting Started

1. **Choose your research field** (biology, psychology, economics, computer science, etc.)
2. **Select a foundational paper** using the [selection criteria](https://averagejoeslab.com/docs/intro#how-to-choose-your-starting-paper)
