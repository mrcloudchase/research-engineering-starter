# Research Engineering Starter Template

A comprehensive template repository to support the [Average Joes Lab Research Engineering Learning Path](https://averagejoeslab.com/docs/research-engineering/getting-started).

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Clone locally**: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/research-engineering-starter.git`
3. **Read the learning path**: [Research Engineering Guide](https://averagejoeslab.com/docs/research-engineering/getting-started)
4. **Choose your paper**: Use `paper-recommendations.md` or select your own
5. **Follow the 10-step process** using this repository structure

## 📚 How This Repository Supports Your Journey

This repository provides templates and structure for the complete research engineering process:

### **Step 1-2: Question & Literature Review** 
→ Use `01-literature-review/` folder

### **Step 3: Hypothesis Formation** 
→ Use `02-hypothesis-design/` folder

### **Step 4-5: Methodology & Experimentation** 
→ Use `03-implementation/` and `04-experiments/` folders

### **Step 6-7: Analysis & Iteration** 
→ Use `05-analysis/` folder

### **Step 8-10: Communication, Review & Next Questions** 
→ Use `06-documentation/` folder

## 🎯 The Research Engineering Process

This repository follows the systematic 10-step research methodology:

1. **Curiosity & Problem Framing** - Identify your research question
2. **Literature Review** - Map existing knowledge
3. **Hypothesis Formation** - Make testable predictions
4. **Methodology Design** - Plan your research approach
5. **Experimentation** - Execute your research plan
6. **Analysis & Interpretation** - Make sense of your results
7. **Iteration** - Refine based on findings
8. **Communication** - Share your discoveries
9. **Peer Review** - Get feedback and validation
10. **Next Questions** - Identify future research directions

## 🗺️ Your Research Journey

### **Getting Started**
1. **Choose your research focus** using `paper-recommendations.md`
2. **Start with literature review** in `01-literature-review/`
3. **Follow the sequential process** through each numbered folder
4. **Use templates and examples** provided in each step
5. **Document everything** for reproducibility

### **Two Learning Paths**
- **Path 1**: Follow the detailed perceptron example throughout
- **Path 2**: Apply the methodology to your own chosen paper

Both paths use the same systematic process and repository structure.
