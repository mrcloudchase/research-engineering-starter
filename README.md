## 🎯 The Research Engineering Process

This repository follows the systematic 10-step research methodology:

1. **Curiosity & Problem Framing** - Identify your research question
2. **Literature Review** - Map existing knowledge
3. **Hypothesis Formation** - Make testable predictions
4. **Methodology Design** - Plan your research approach
5. **Experimentation** - Execute your research plan
6. **Analysis & Interpretation** - Make sense of your results
7. **Iteration** - Refine based on findings
8. **Communication** - Share your discoveries
9. **Peer Review** - Get feedback and validation
10. **Next Questions** - Identify future research directions

## 🗺️ Your Research Journey

### **Getting Started**
1. **Choose your research focus** using `paper-recommendations.md`
2. **Start with literature review** in `01-literature-review/`
3. **Follow the sequential process** through each numbered folder
4. **Use templates and examples** provided in each step
5. **Document everything** for reproducibility

### **Two Learning Paths**
- **Path 1**: Follow the detailed perceptron example throughout
- **Path 2**: Apply the methodology to your own chosen paper

Both paths use the same systematic process and repository structure.

## 💡 Key Features

- **Sequential structure** following the research methodology
- **Comprehensive templates** for each step
- **Complete perceptron example** showing every step with real code and results
- **Best practices** for research engineering
- **Community support** and resources

## 📊 Perceptron Example Results

The included perceptron example demonstrates:
- **Literature Review**: Historical context of the 1958 perceptron and XOR limitation
- **Hypothesis**: Multi-layer networks can solve XOR while single-layer cannot
- **Implementation**: Both architectures built from scratch in Python
- **Experiments**: 20 runs per configuration with statistical validation
- **Results**: Single-layer achieves 38% accuracy, multi-layer achieves 94% (p<0.001, d=9.23)
- **Documentation**: Full research paper, tutorial, and presentation materials
