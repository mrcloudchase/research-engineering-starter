## 🎯 How to Use This Template

### Phase 1: Research Foundations (Weeks 1-4) 📚
**Build your research methodology foundation**
- Use `phase-1-foundations/literature-review/` for your literature review work
- Document your research setup in `phase-1-foundations/research-setup/`
- **Perceptron Example**: Review Frank Rosenblatt's 1958 paper and understand historical context
- **Just-in-Time Learning**: Basic algebra and research fundamentals ([see prerequisites guide](https://averagejoeslab.com/docs/intro#prerequisites---start-where-you-are))

### Phase 2: Technical Skills (Weeks 5-8) 💻
**Develop technical skills for research engineering**
- Implement your chosen paper in `phase-2-technical-skills/implementation/`
- Track experiments in `phase-2-technical-skills/experiments/`
- Set up research engineering tools in `phase-2-technical-skills/tools-setup/`
- **Perceptron Example**: Implement perceptron from scratch, discover XOR limitation
- **Just-in-Time Learning**: Python programming, linear algebra basics, experiment tracking tools

### Phase 3: Research Practice (Weeks 9-12) 🔬
**Apply skills to real research projects**
- Design your research project in `phase-3-research-practice/hypothesis-design/`
- Conduct systematic experiments in `phase-3-research-practice/experiments/`
- Analyze results in `phase-3-research-practice/analysis/`
- **Perceptron Example**: Design MLP solution for XOR, discover training bottleneck
- **Just-in-Time Learning**: Statistical analysis, experimental design, hypothesis testing

### Phase 4: Community Contribution (Weeks 13-16) 🤝
**Contribute to the research community**
- Create documentation in `phase-4-community-contribution/documentation/`
- Prepare presentations in `phase-4-community-contribution/presentations/`
- Share community contributions in `phase-4-community-contribution/community/`
- **Perceptron Example**: Document complete journey, mentor newcomers
- **Just-in-Time Learning**: Scientific writing, presentation skills, mentoring practices

## 🔬 Research Engineering Best Practices

This template follows research engineering best practices:

- **Version Control**: All work is tracked in Git
- **Reproducibility**: Clear documentation and environment setup
- **Experiment Tracking**: Systematic logging of experiments and results
- **Open Science**: Transparent sharing of methods and findings

## 🤝 Community

- **Join the [Average Joes Lab Discord](https://discord.gg/averagejoeslab)** for support and collaboration
- **Share your progress** using the `#research-engineering-path` channel
- **Find mentors** and collaborate with fellow researchers
- **Contribute back** by helping newcomers on their journey

## 📚 Learning Resources

All the resources you need are linked in the [Research Engineering Learning Path](https://averagejoeslab.com/docs/intro), including:

- Free tutorials for every tool and concept
- Step-by-step guides for each phase
- Examples across different research fields
- Community support and mentorship

## 📋 Prerequisites - Start Where You Are

**The Reality: You Need Less Than You Think!** Research engineering is about methodology and systematic thinking, not perfect prerequisites.

### Universal Prerequisites (All Fields):
- **Curiosity** - Genuine interest in understanding how things work
- **Basic computer literacy** - Comfortable with files, software, internet research
- **High school mathematics** - Basic algebra and statistics (learn more as needed)
- **Willingness to learn** - Persistence when things don't work the first time
- **Basic programming** - Any language (Python recommended for versatility)

### What You DON'T Need:
- ❌ Advanced degrees or credentials
- ❌ Years of domain expertise  
- ❌ Perfect mathematical background
- ❌ Expensive equipment or software
- ❌ Institutional affiliation

**Field-Specific Variations**: Prerequisites vary by field, but you can learn as you go. See the [complete prerequisites guide](https://averagejoeslab.com/docs/intro#prerequisites---start-where-you-are) for details on math requirements by field and the "Just-in-Time Learning" strategy.

## 🌟 Getting Started

1. **Choose your research field** (biology, psychology, economics, computer science, etc.)
2. **Select a foundational paper** using the [selection criteria](https://averagejoeslab.com/docs/intro#how-to-choose-your-starting-paper)
3. **Review prerequisites** for your chosen field using the [prerequisites guide](https://averagejoeslab.com/docs/intro#prerequisites---start-where-you-are)
4. **Start with Phase 1** and work through the learning path systematically
5. **Document everything** in this repository structure
6. **Share your journey** with the community
