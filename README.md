### Universal Prerequisites (All Fields):
- **Curiosity** - Genuine interest in understanding how things work
- **Basic computer literacy** - Comfortable with files, software, internet research
- **High school mathematics** - Basic algebra and statistics (learn more as needed)
- **Willingness to learn** - Persistence when things don't work the first time
- **Basic programming** - Any language (Python recommended for versatility)

### What You DON'T Need:
- ❌ Advanced degrees or credentials
- ❌ Years of domain expertise  
- ❌ Perfect mathematical background
- ❌ Expensive equipment or software
- ❌ Institutional affiliation

**Field-Specific Variations**: Prerequisites vary by field, but you can learn as you go. See the [complete prerequisites guide](https://averagejoeslab.com/docs/research-engineering) for details on math requirements by field and the "Just-in-Time Learning" strategy.
