# Phase 3: Hypothesis Design

## ðŸŽ¯ Week 9-10: Research Project Design & Experimental Rigor

This folder contains your original research project design and hypothesis formation.

### Getting Started

Design your original research project to address limitations discovered in Phase 2:

1. **Hypothesis Formation**
2. **Experimental Design**
3. **Ablation Planning**
4. **Statistical Planning**

### Recommended Files

- `research-proposal.md` - Complete research proposal
- `hypothesis.md` - Clear, testable hypotheses
- `experimental-design.md` - Detailed experimental methodology
- `ablation-plan.md` - Systematic component analysis strategy
- `statistical-plan.md` - Statistical analysis methodology

### Research Proposal Template

#### 1. Problem Statement
- What limitation did you discover in Phase 2?
- Why is this limitation important to address?
- What gap in knowledge does this represent?

#### 2. Research Questions
- Primary research question
- Secondary research questions
- Specific, measurable, achievable questions

#### 3. Hypotheses
- Clear, testable hypotheses
- Null and alternative hypotheses
- Expected outcomes and reasoning

#### 4. Methodology
- Experimental approach
- Controls and variables
- Data collection methods
- Analysis techniques

#### 5. Expected Contributions
- What new knowledge will this generate?
- How will this advance the field?
- What are the practical implications?

### Experimental Design Framework

#### Variables
- **Independent Variables**: What you're manipulating
- **Dependent Variables**: What you're measuring
- **Control Variables**: What you're keeping constant
- **Confounding Variables**: What might interfere

#### Controls
- **Positive Controls**: Known to work
- **Negative Controls**: Known to fail
- **Baseline Comparisons**: Standard methods
- **Ablation Controls**: Component removal

### Example: Perceptron to MLP Research

If following the Perceptron example:

#### Research Question
"Can multi-layer neural networks solve problems that single-layer perceptrons cannot?"

#### Hypothesis
"Multi-layer perceptrons with hidden layers can learn non-linearly separable functions like XOR, while single-layer perceptrons cannot."

#### Experimental Design
1. **Comparison Study**: Single-layer vs multi-layer performance
2. **Problem Set**: AND, OR (linearly separable) vs XOR (non-linearly separable)
3. **Architecture Variations**: Test 2-layer, 3-layer networks
4. **Training Methods**: Explore different training approaches

#### Ablation Plan
- Test impact of hidden layer size
- Test different activation functions
- Test various initialization methods
- Test learning rate sensitivity
