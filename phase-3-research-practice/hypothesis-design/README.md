def calculate_sample_size(effect_size, alpha=0.05, power=0.8):
    """
    Calculate required sample size for detecting effect
    """
    # For t-test comparison
    from scipy.stats import norm
    
    z_alpha = norm.ppf(1 - alpha/2)
    z_beta = norm.ppf(power)
    
    n = 2 * ((z_alpha + z_beta) / effect_size) ** 2
    return int(np.ceil(n))

### Enhanced Perceptron Example Research Design

#### Complete Research Proposal Template

##### 1. Problem Statement
**Limitation Discovered**: Single-layer perceptrons cannot solve non-linearly separable problems like XOR.

**Research Gap**: While multi-layer architectures were proposed in 1962, effective training methods weren't developed until 1986. This 25-year gap represents a critical implementation bottleneck in neural network research.

**Significance**: Understanding this historical bottleneck demonstrates how research engineering methodology can systematically identify and address fundamental limitations in proposed solutions.

##### 2. Research Questions
**Primary**: Can multi-layer perceptrons solve non-linearly separable problems that single-layer perceptrons cannot?

**Secondary**: 
- What architectural factors (hidden units, layers) affect MLP performance on XOR?
- Why did the field struggle for 25 years to train MLPs effectively?
- How does systematic experimentation reveal implementation bottlenecks?

##### 3. Hypotheses
**H1**: Multi-layer perceptrons with hidden layers can learn XOR function (accuracy > 90%)
**H0**: Multi-layer perceptrons perform no better than single-layer perceptrons on XOR (accuracy â‰¤ 50%)

**H2**: MLP performance on XOR increases with hidden layer size up to optimal point
**H0**: Hidden layer size has no effect on XOR learning performance

**H3**: Without backpropagation, MLPs cannot be trained effectively on XOR
**H0**: Training method has no effect on MLP performance

##### 4. Experimental Design

###### Variables
- **Independent Variables**: 
  - Architecture type (single-layer vs multi-layer)
  - Hidden layer size (2, 4, 8, 16 units)
  - Training method (random updates vs backpropagation)
- **Dependent Variables**: 
  - Classification accuracy on XOR
  - Training convergence time
  - Training stability (loss variance)
- **Control Variables**: 
  - Learning rate (0.1)
  - Random seed management
  - Training epochs (1000)
  - Input data (standardized XOR dataset)

###### Controls and Baselines
- **Negative Control**: Random classifier (expected 50% accuracy)
- **Positive Control**: Known working solution (if available)
- **Baseline**: Single-layer perceptron performance
- **Historical Control**: Pre-backpropagation training methods

##### 5. Statistical Analysis Plan

###### Sample Size Calculation
```python
# Expecting large effect size (d=1.5) for architecture comparison
required_n = calculate_sample_size(effect_size=1.5, alpha=0.05, power=0.9)
print(f"Required runs per condition: {required_n}")  # Likely ~8-10 runs

# For ablation studies (medium effect size d=0.5)
ablation_n = calculate_sample_size(effect_size=0.5, alpha=0.05, power=0.8)
print(f"Required runs for ablation: {ablation_n}")  # Likely ~16-20 runs
```

###### Statistical Tests Planned
1. **Architecture Comparison**: Independent t-test (perceptron vs MLP accuracy)
2. **Hidden Unit Analysis**: One-way ANOVA (effect of hidden layer size)
3. **Training Method Comparison**: Independent t-test (random vs backpropagation)
4. **Multiple Comparisons**: Bonferroni correction for family-wise error rate

###### Effect Size Interpretation
- **Small effect**: d = 0.2 (minimal practical significance)
- **Medium effect**: d = 0.5 (moderate practical significance)  
- **Large effect**: d = 0.8+ (substantial practical significance)
