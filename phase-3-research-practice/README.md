# Phase 3: Research Practice (Weeks 9-12)

Apply your skills to real research projects through systematic experimentation and analysis.

## 🔬 What You'll Do

### Week 9-10: Research Project Design & Experimental Rigor
- Form clear, testable hypotheses
- Design rigorous experimental methodology
- Plan systematic ablation studies
- Establish statistical analysis framework

### Week 11-12: Research Execution & Analysis
- Conduct controlled experiments with proper baselines
- Perform systematic ablation studies
- Apply statistical analysis and bias detection
- Document and interpret results
