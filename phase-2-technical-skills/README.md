# Phase 2: Technical Skills (Weeks 5-8)

Develop technical skills for research engineering through implementation and systematic experimentation.

## 💻 What You'll Do

### Week 5-6: Programming for Research
- Implement your chosen paper from scratch
- Apply clean coding practices and documentation
- Create modular, testable code
- Set up proper development workflow

### Week 7-8: Research Engineering Tools and Methodologies
- Apply experiment tracking and version control
- Conduct systematic testing and validation
- Perform baseline comparisons and hyperparameter analysis
- Discover limitations through proper methodology

## 📁 Folders

- **`implementation/`** - Your code implementation of the chosen paper
- **`experiments/`** - Systematic experiments and research engineering practices
- **`tools-setup/`** - Development environment and tool configuration

## 🎯 Milestone

Implement and reproduce your chosen research paper using proper research engineering methodology, systematically identifying capabilities and limitations.
