## 💡 Pro Tips for Success

### Week 1-2 Focus
- **Don't overthink paper selection** - You can learn from any foundational paper
- **Use the templates** - They're comprehensive and will guide your thinking
- **Reference the perceptron example** - It shows the depth and style expected
- **Start writing immediately** - Don't wait to understand everything perfectly

### Common First-Day Questions

**Q: How do I know if my paper is suitable?**
A: Check these criteria:
- [ ] It's historically significant in its field
- [ ] You can implement it in ~50-200 lines of code
- [ ] It has known limitations to explore
- [ ] Resources exist to help you understand it

**Q: What if I don't understand all the math/concepts?**
A: That's normal! The "just-in-time learning" approach means you learn what you need as you go. Start with what you understand and build from there.

**Q: How much time should I dedicate?**
A: Plan for 5-10 hours per week. More is fine, but consistency matters more than intensity.

**Q: Can I work on multiple papers?**
A: Focus on one paper through all 4 phases first. You'll learn the methodology better this way.

## 🎯 Your Week 1 Goals

By the end of Week 1, you should have:
- [ ] Selected your research paper
- [ ] Completed Sections 1-5 of your literature review
- [ ] Understood the paper's main contribution
- [ ] Identified the historical context
- [ ] Started gathering additional resources
