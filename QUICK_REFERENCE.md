# 📋 Research Engineering Quick Reference Card

## 🎯 The 4-Phase Journey (16 Weeks)

### Phase 1: FOUNDATIONS (Weeks 1-4)
**Goal**: Understand your chosen paper deeply
- **Weeks 1-2**: Literature Review → `phase-1-foundations/literature-review/`
- **Weeks 3-4**: Setup Environment → `phase-1-foundations/research-setup/`
- **Milestone**: Complete literature review

### Phase 2: TECHNICAL (Weeks 5-8)
**Goal**: Implement and test your paper
- **Weeks 5-6**: Implementation → `phase-2-technical-skills/implementation/`
- **Weeks 7-8**: Experiments → `phase-2-technical-skills/experiments/`
- **Milestone**: Discover limitations (e.g., XOR problem)

### Phase 3: RESEARCH (Weeks 9-12)
**Goal**: Conduct original research on limitations
- **Weeks 9-10**: Design Research → `phase-3-research-practice/hypothesis-design/`
- **Weeks 11-12**: Run Experiments → `phase-3-research-practice/experiments/`
- **Milestone**: Validated findings with statistics

### Phase 4: COMMUNITY (Weeks 13-16)
**Goal**: Share your journey with others
- **Weeks 13-14**: Documentation → `phase-4-community-contribution/documentation/`
- **Weeks 15-16**: Share & Mentor → `phase-4-community-contribution/`
- **Milestone**: Published work, helped someone else start

## 📁 Key Files & Templates

| File | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `GETTING_STARTED.md` | First hour guide | Day 1 |
| `paper-recommendations.md` | Paper suggestions | Before Week 1 |
| `literature-review-template.md` | Literature review structure | Weeks 1-2 |
| `perceptron-literature-review.md` | Complete example | Reference throughout |
| `research-proposal.md` | Research design template | Week 9 |
| `research-report.md` | Final documentation | Week 13 |

## 💻 Essential Commands

```bash
# Initial setup
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/research-engineering-starter.git
cd research-engineering-starter

# Save your work
git add -A
git commit -m "Phase X: [what you did]"
git push origin main

# Python environment (example)
conda create -n research python=3.9
conda activate research
pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter pytest
```

## 🔍 Paper Selection Criteria

✅ **Good Paper Choice**:
- Historical significance
- Implementable (50-200 lines)
- Known limitations
- Available resources
- Interests you

❌ **Avoid**:
- Too recent (< 5 years old)
- Too complex to implement
- No clear limitations
- Proprietary/closed source
- No learning resources

## 📊 Weekly Time Commitment

- **Minimum**: 5 hours/week
- **Recommended**: 10 hours/week
- **Intensive**: 15+ hours/week

**Distribution**:
- 40% Reading/Research
- 30% Implementation/Coding
- 20% Documentation
- 10% Community/Discussion

## 🎓 Learning Philosophy

### Just-in-Time Learning
Don't learn everything upfront. Learn what you need when you need it:

| Week | Learn As Needed |
|------|-----------------|
| 1-2 | Basic research methods, paper's domain basics |
| 3-4 | Git, Python setup, basic statistics |
| 5-6 | Programming concepts for implementation |
| 7-8 | Experiment tracking, data visualization |
| 9-10 | Hypothesis testing, experimental design |
| 11-12 | Statistical analysis, significance testing |
| 13-14 | Scientific writing, documentation |
| 15-16 | Presentation, teaching skills |

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls & Solutions

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "My paper is too hard" | Break it down, use more resources, ask for help |
| "I don't understand the math" | Learn just what you need, use visual resources |
| "My implementation doesn't work" | Start simpler, use the perceptron example |
| "I can't find limitations" | They're there! Test edge cases systematically |
| "I'm behind schedule" | Adjust pace, focus on learning over speed |
