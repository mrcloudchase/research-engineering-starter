# Step 8-10: Documentation, Communication & Next Questions

**Research Steps**: Communication + Peer Review + Next Questions

## Overview

Transform your research into shareable knowledge that others can understand, reproduce, and build upon. This completes the research cycle and starts the next one.

## Your Task

Create comprehensive documentation of your research journey that enables others to learn from your work and continue the research cycle.

- [ ] Prepare presentation materials
- [ ] Submit to appropriate venues
- [ ] Share with community for feedback

## Quick Start with Perceptron Documentation

```bash
# Navigate to documentation
cd 06-documentation/perceptron-example/

# View the complete research report
cat research-report.md
# Full academic paper with:
# - Abstract summarizing findings
# - Complete methodology
# - Statistical results (p<0.001, d=9.23)
# - Discussion and conclusions

# Read the tutorial for hands-on learning
cat tutorial.md
# Step-by-step guide with:
