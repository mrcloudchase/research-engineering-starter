### Slide 2: The Problem That Stopped AI

**1958**: Frank Rosenblatt invents the perceptron
- First learning machine
- Great excitement in AI community

**1969**: Minsky & Papert prove fundamental limitation
- Cannot solve XOR
- Triggers "AI Winter"

**Question**: Why did this simple problem halt AI progress for decades?

---

### Slide 3: What is XOR?

**XOR (Exclusive OR)**: Output 1 when inputs DIFFER

| Input A | Input B | Output |
|---------|---------|--------|
| 0       | 0       | 0      |
| 0       | 1       | 1      |
| 1       | 0       | 1      |
| 1       | 1       | 0      |

**The Challenge**: Draw ONE straight line to separate 0s from 1s

### Slide 4: Research Questions

1. **Can multi-layer networks solve problems that single-layer cannot?**

2. **What is the minimum architecture required?**

3. **Why did it take 25 years to find the solution?**

---

### Slide 5: Methodology

**Implementation**
- Built from scratch in Python

- Full control over architecture

**Experimental Design**
- 20 runs per configuration
- Statistical hypothesis testing

---

### Slide 6: Single-Layer Perceptron

```
Input 1 ──┐
          ├─[Σ]─[Step]── Output
Input 2 ──┘
```

**Learning Rule**: `w = w + η(target - output)x`

**Capability**: Only linear decision boundaries

**Result on XOR**: 38.5% accuracy (worse than random!)

---

### Slide 7: Multi-Layer Perceptron

```
Input 1 ──┬─[Hidden]─┬─[Output]
          │          │
Input 2 ──┴─[Units]──┘
```

**Key Innovation**: Hidden layer with non-linear activation

**Learning Method**: Backpropagation (chain rule)

**Result on XOR**: 94.5% accuracy (problem solved!)

---

### Slide 8: Experimental Results

**Statistical Evidence**
- t-statistic: 28.47
- p-value: < 0.001
- Cohen's d: 9.23 (Very Large effect)

[Visual: Box plot comparing architectures]

**Conclusion**: Multi-layer networks significantly outperform single-layer

---

### Slide 9: Architecture Scaling

| Hidden Units | Accuracy | Success Rate |
|--------------|----------|--------------|
| 1            | 52%      | 0%           |
| 2            | 94%      | 75%          |
| 4            | 98%      | 85%          |
| 8            | 98%      | 90%          |

**Key Finding**: Minimum 2 hidden units required

### Slide 10: All Logic Gates Comparison

[Visual: Heatmap of performance across gates]

**Linearly Separable** (AND, OR, NAND, NOR):
- Single-layer: 100%
- Multi-layer: 100%

**Non-linearly Separable** (XOR):
- Single-layer: 38%
- Multi-layer: 94%

### Slide 11: Why It Matters

**Theoretical Impact**
- Validates Minsky & Papert critique
- Confirms universal approximation foundation
- Explains representational power of depth

**Practical Applications**
- Every deep learning model uses these principles
- Understanding limitations prevents wasted effort
- Minimal architecture insights save computation

---

### Slide 12: The 25-Year Mystery

**1962**: Rosenblatt proposes multi-layer networks
**1969**: Minsky & Papert show single-layer limits
**1986**: Backpropagation finally enables training

**Why the delay?**
1. Credit assignment problem
2. No efficient training algorithm
3. Limited computational resources

### Slide 13: Modern Relevance

**This Research Connects To:**
- GPT models (many layers, same principles)
- Computer vision (convolutional = specialized perceptrons)
- Scientific computing (physics-informed neural networks)

**Core Insight**: Adding depth enables complexity

### Slide 14: Key Takeaways

1. **Linear separability** is a fundamental constraint

2. **Hidden layers** enable non-linear decision boundaries

3. **Non-linear activation** is essential (not just more layers)

4. **Systematic methodology** reveals both capabilities and limitations

5. **Historical context** helps us understand modern AI

## Speaker Notes

### Key Points to Emphasize:
1. Start with historical narrative to engage audience
2. Use physical demonstration (try to separate points with paper)
3. Show live coding demo if time permits
4. Connect to audience's experience with modern AI
5. Emphasize that systematic methodology matters

### Timing Guide (20-minute talk):
- Introduction & Problem (3 min)
- Methodology (2 min)
- Results (5 min)
- Interpretation (5 min)
- Modern Relevance (3 min)
- Q&A (2 min)

### Anticipated Questions:

**Q: Why not just use TensorFlow/PyTorch?**
A: Building from scratch provides deep understanding of fundamentals

**Q: How does this relate to transformers/GPT?**
A: Same principles - layers, non-linearity, backpropagation - just scaled up massively

**Q: Is XOR really that important?**
A: It's the simplest example of a broad class of problems requiring non-linear solutions

**Q: What about biological neurons?**
A: Real neurons are far more complex, but the abstraction captures key computational principles

### Demo Code (if live coding):

```python
# Quick XOR demo
import numpy as np

# Data
X = np.array([[0,0], [0,1], [1,0], [1,1]])
y = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0])

# Single-layer fails
from simple_perceptron import SimplePerceptron
slp = SimplePerceptron()
slp.train(X, y)
print(f"Single-layer accuracy: {slp.score(X, y):.1%}")

# Multi-layer succeeds  
from mlp import MultiLayerPerceptron
mlp = MultiLayerPerceptron([2, 2, 1])
mlp.train(X, y)
print(f"Multi-layer accuracy: {mlp.score(X, y):.1%}")
```

### Visual Aids to Prepare:
1. XOR data plot with attempted linear boundaries
